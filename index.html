      I know it’s been just a short while since we started talking, but it already feels like I’ve known you for way longer.
      You’ve got this beautiful mix of being sweet, stubborn, caring, and a little chuhi-type childish that somehow makes everything better.

      That day at the bus stand — the ice cream was insanely sweet, but you still had it just so I wouldn’t feel bad.
      That moment stuck with me more than you know. Little things like that show how warm and thoughtful you truly are.
    </p>

      I genuinely hope this year brings you closer to everything you dream of — your big house, your Thar, and a life full of peace and happiness.
      You deserve it all and more. Keep being the hardworking, kind soul you are.
